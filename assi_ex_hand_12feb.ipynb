    "\n",
    "In Python, an Exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program, and it disrupts the normal flow of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are different from Syntax Errors, which are errors that occur when the Python interpreter cannot understand the code because of incorrect syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Exceptions and Syntax Errors is that Syntax Errors are caught by the interpreter at compile time, while Exceptions are caught at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur due to various reasons such as improper user input, lack of resources, network failures, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Syntax Errors occur due to coding mistakes such as misspelling a keyword, missing a punctuation mark, or using an incorrect variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Exceptions is necessary to prevent the program from abruptly terminating and to provide useful error messages to the user.\n",
